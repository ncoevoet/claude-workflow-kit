# (skills/, README.md) must contain NO real employer / product / repo / ticket
# names. This repo is PUBLIC, so the REAL blocklist lives in a gitignored
# sibling (anonymization-blocklist.txt) and is never committed. When that file
# is absent (e.g. on CI) the script falls back to the committed placeholder
# example, whose invented patterns never match real content — so the mechanism
# is exercised everywhere while real enforcement happens locally pre-commit.
#
# Blocklist format: one extended-regex per line; blank lines and #-comments
# ignored. Exit 0 = clean, 1 = a blocked name was found, 2 = misconfig.
